/* Unfortunately the newer OASIS PKCS#11 specification (v2.40 and later) state
 * in ยง2.1 causing confusion (and incompatility if honored on UNIX):
 *   Cryptoki structures are packed to occupy as little space as is possible.
 *   Cryptoki structures SHALL be packed with 1-byte alignment.
 *
 * The earlier PKCS#11 v2.30 wording is:
 *   Cryptoki structures are packed to occupy as little space as is possible.
 *   In particular, on the Windows platforms, Cryptoki structures should be packed
 *   with 1-byte alignment. In a UNIX environment, it may or may not be necessary
 *   (or even possible) to alter the byte-alignment of structures.
 *
 * Thus, use default alignment for Crypto structures for Linux. This is also
 * the defacto standard among all other users and implementations of PKCS#11.
